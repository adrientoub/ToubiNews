#ToubiNews

##Description

This application is an app to read nntp news on your iPhone.
This application makes use of the
[https://github.com/Dubrzr/NG-Notifier](NG Notifier API), and can be used
to read any newsgroup added to the
[https://42portal.com/ng-notifier/](NG Notifier website).

This app is currently only able to read EPITA's news. The EPITA news server
is available at news.epita.fr.

This app will as soon as the NG-notifier's API allows it, allow you to post
news.

You can for now search among all news or just among the news of a particular
newsgroup.

This app is only available for iPhone but a similar application is very soon
going to be available for Android.
