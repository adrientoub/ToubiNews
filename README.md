# ToubiNews

## Description

This application is an app to read nntp news on your iPhone.
This application makes use of the
[NG Notifier API](https://github.com/Dubrzr/NG-Notifier), and can be used
to read any newsgroup added to the
[NG Notifier website](https://ng-notifier.42portal.com/).

This app is currently only able to read EPITA's news. The EPITA news server
is available at news.epita.fr.

You can for now search among all news or just among the news of a particular
newsgroup.

This app is only available for iPhone but a similar application is available
for Android with the name
[EpiNotifier](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bertet.francois.epinotifier&hl=en).
